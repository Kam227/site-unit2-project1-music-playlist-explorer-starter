### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The discussions and labs were helpful in the beginning when we were working on HTML and CSS. However, there could've been more depth to the discussions regarding Javascript and integrating data into our program dynamically. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Due to the fast-pace nature of the class, we were given the option to skip one of our labs (Lab 4: Virtual Book Club). I opted out of doing this lab to spend more time working on the Music Playlist Explorer program. However, information provided in Lab 4 was crucial, especially for completing some of the stretch features. Given more time, I would've looked into Lab 4 more, and possibly would've able to implement more of the stretch features (specifically, add a new playlist feature AND search feature)

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My final project demo went well, I just wish I could've implemented more of the stretch features, as I did plan to complete them all. 

### Open-source libraries used

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

My cohert instructors, Makayla and Jacky, were helpful in explaining Javascript concepts and assisting in the programming process.
